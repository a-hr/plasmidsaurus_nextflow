# a-hr/ONT-splicing-pipeline pipeline parameters


## Introduction

A pipeline to process the sequencing output coming from Plasmidsaurus. It can also be used with standard Nanopore data, but keep in mind that each sample must be provided as a single FASTQ file.

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. QC of the FASTQ files
2. Alignment of the reads to the reference genome
3. Generation of BAM files
4. Generation of sashimi-plots using ggsashimi

## Installation

The pipeline is written in Nextflow, a workflow manager that allows to run the pipeline in a wide variety of systems. It is configured to be run either on a SLURM-managed HPC cluster or a local machine, though it can be run on a cloud instance or using other workload managers by editing the configuration file according to [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-scopes).


### Installing in a local machine

In your local machine, there are two ways of running the pipeline:

1. Using EPI2ME: the easiest way for those without bioinformatics experience. It's just a graphical interface that allows you to run the pipeline. Below will be explained how to install it.
2. Using the command line: for those with bioinformatics experience. It follows the same procedure as running in a cluster, so it will be explained in the `Installing in a cluster` section.

#### Installing EPI2ME

[Install EPI2ME](https://labs.epi2me.io/installation/) on your system and follow the instructions on the app to install all the dependencies (Java, Docker and Nextflow). To add the pipeline to your saved workflows simply copy this repository's URL and paste it on the "Add workflow" section of the EPI2ME interface.

### Installing in a cluster

If using Nextflow/nf-core, clone the repository and install the basic dependencies (Nextflow). The easiest way to do so is using conda. The pipeline can be run on any system that supports Docker or Singularity. If using Windows, we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-hr/plasmidsaurus_nextflow.git
```

The internal dependencies of the pipeline are managed by Nextflow, so you don't need to worry about them. If for some reason Nextflow fails to download them when using Singularity (they are provided as Docker containers), you can manually download them with the Makefile:

```bash
# make sure you have Singularity installed and available
make pull
```

The pipeline is especially tailored to be run on a HPC cluster, though it can seamlessly be run on a local machine and, with some configuration, on a cloud instance.

## Usage

### Running with EPI2ME

1. Open EPI2ME and go to the "Workflows" tab.
2. Select the workflow.
3. Fill in the parameters.
4. In the `profile` section, type in `local_docker`.
5. Run the pipeline.

### Running with the command line

1. Go to the directory where you cloned the repository.
2. Fill in the parameters in the `input_params.yaml` file.
3. Make sure your system has Docker/Singularity and Nextflow available.
4. Run the pipeline in the cluster with the following command:

```bash
sbatch launch.sh
```

> The launch script is configured to run the pipeline in a SLURM-managed HPC cluster. If you are using another workload manager, you will need to edit the script accordingly.  

***If you are running the pipeline in a local machine, you can run it with the following command:***

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -profile local_docker -params-file input_params.yaml
# or with Singularity
nextflow run main.nf -profile local_singularity -params-file input_params.yaml
```
